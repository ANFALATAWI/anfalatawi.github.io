I'm Anfal, a software engineer. I studied Computer Science in university. Mid-way through that journey, I realized I was more facsinated by how software is built, scaled & maintaned, thus, I prefer building now.

I write for everyone, I aim that my posts are readble and understandable by every beginner in the field. I always have 1st-year-CS-Anfal in mind, captivated by everything, no idea where to start. Well, I hope this blog is one entry point for people like her!

### My main interests are
- **Software Documentation**. What's amazing code if no developer understands how to use it?
- **Best Practices**. Don't just write functioning software, write readble maintanble scalable *functioning* software.

However, I write about most of what I encounter and believe is worth sharing.
